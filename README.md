# DataTalk — Seamless Self-Service Intelligence

**NatWest Code for Purpose India Hackathon 2026 | Talk to Data**

DataTalk enables any user to ask questions about their data in plain English and receive clear, verifiable answers in seconds. No SQL, no dashboards, no data team required. Upload a dataset, ask a question, and get an answer backed by a source reference, a confidence score, and a chart where applicable.

The system is built on three pillars from the NatWest problem statement: **Clarity** (answers non-experts can act on immediately), **Trust** (every response cites its data source and carries a reliability rating), and **Speed** (a multi-agent pipeline routes each question to the right tool automatically, with no manual steps required).

## Data Preprocessing & Quality Wizard

The Data Preprocessing Wizard is a seamless, user-in-the-loop data cleaning pipeline built into the file upload flow. It ensures that the AI agents and DuckDB analytics engine operate on highly structured, clean data — without accidentally mutating data the user wants to retain.

### Three-Phase Pipeline

**Phase 1 — Detection & Auto-fixes (`POST /api/upload`)**

When the user uploads a file, the backend parses it into a temporary Pandas DataFrame and runs the `detect_issues` pipeline, producing two categories of output:

- **Silent Auto-fixes (Zero Risk):** Safe transformations applied immediately — stripping whitespace, removing fully blank rows, and dropping exact duplicates.
- **Medium-Risk Detections:** Ambiguous issues flagged for user review — parsing currency symbols into numbers, standardising mixed date formats, replacing nulls using median estimation.

The DataFrame is cached in temporary memory mapped to a `session_id`. No database is created at this stage.

**Phase 2 — User Validation (`DataPreprocessingWizard.jsx`)**

A minimalist, interactive UI intercepts the loading funnel and presents the user with a full report of the auto-fixes already applied. For every medium-risk issue detected, the user sees a YES/NO toggle with a concrete data example for context. The user can either **Apply & Continue** with their chosen rules, or **Skip** to retain the raw dataset entirely.

**Phase 3 — Database Serialisation (`POST /api/preprocess/apply`)**

The backend consumes the approved decisions, applies them via `apply_decisions`, and loads the cleaned dataset into the persistent DuckDB session. AI parameters — `schema`, `anomalies`, and `data_quality` — are computed exclusively on this cleaned dataset.

### Preprocessing Flow

```
User uploads file
      |
      v
Pandas temp DataFrame (in-memory, no DB yet)
      |
      v
detect_issues pipeline
      |
      +---> Silent auto-fixes applied immediately
      |
      +---> Medium-risk issues → DataPreprocessingWizard UI
                  |
                  v
         User toggles YES/NO per issue
                  |
                  v
         POST /api/preprocess/apply
                  |
                  v
         apply_decisions → cleaned DataFrame
                  |
                  v
         Loaded into DuckDB session
                  |
                  v
         Schema + quality score + anomaly report
         computed on clean data only
```

### Extensibility

The engine uses a modular, class-based pipeline (`preprocessor.py`). Adding a new data cleaning rule requires only defining a class that inherits `PreprocessStep` with a `detect()` condition and an `apply()` execution body — no changes to the core pipeline are needed.

### PDF Export Integration

All data transformations — both zero-risk auto-fixes and user-approved decisions — are automatically forwarded through the chat `system` payload in `useChat.js`. When a PDF export is requested, `pdf_generator.py` parses this history to embed a chronological **"Applied Data Preprocessing" audit table** in the report, documenting exactly how the dataset was mutated before analysis began.

## Security by Design

DataTalk treats data privacy as a hard architectural constraint, not a configuration option. The LLM has no access to your actual data at any stage. Security is enforced through five independent layers, each operating without relying on any other:

**Layer 1 — Schema-only LLM prompting**
Agents send the LLM only column names and data types. The LLM returns SQL or Python targeting that schema. Query execution happens entirely on the local server. The LLM never receives a single data value.

**Layer 2 — Python sandbox with hard boundaries**
Statistical analysis requires code execution, which carries inherent risk in most systems. Every piece of LLM-generated Python runs inside a restricted interpreter with a fixed import whitelist: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `sklearn`. The `open()` builtin is removed. OS, socket, and subprocess modules are inaccessible at the interpreter level. A 30-second thread-based timeout terminates any runaway or malicious execution. No data can leave the machine through generated code.

**Layer 3 — Session isolation**
Every file upload is assigned a UUID. Each session maintains its own database file, its own in-memory cache, and its own connection object. No session can read, query, or infer data from another session.

**Layer 4 — Sensitive column masking**
Users can flag individual columns as sensitive before querying. When a flagged column appears in a result, the Explain Agent is bypassed entirely. No LLM processes values from those columns, even indirectly.

**Layer 5 — Input validation and query safety**
Accepted file extensions: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.json`, `.tsv`. Maximum upload size: 50 MB. Column names are normalised on ingest. All database queries use identifier quoting and parameterisation to prevent injection.

```
Data boundary — enforced at every step:

  User uploads file
        |
        v
  Preprocessing Wizard (local, in-memory only)
        |
        v
  Analytical DB (local server — cleaned data)
        |
        v
  Schema extracted (names + types only)
        |
        v
  Sent to LLM
        |
  Raw data stops here, always
```

## How DataTalk Compares

Most natural language data tools send your data to a remote model to generate answers. DataTalk inverts this: the intelligence comes to your data, not the other way around.

| Dimension | Standard NL-to-Data Tools | DataTalk |
|---|---|---|
| Data sent to LLM | Full rows and values | Schema only — no data values ever |
| Analysis depth | SQL aggregations only | SQL plus sandboxed Python: stats, ML, custom charts |
| LLM provider | Vendor-locked to one API | Any provider, swapped via one line in `.env` |
| Sensitive data handling | No mechanism exists | Column-level masking with automatic agent bypass |
| Code execution safety | Unrestricted or absent | Whitelisted sandbox, file I/O blocked, 30 s hard timeout |
| Answer reliability signal | None provided | Confidence score 0 to 100 with cited data source |
| Metric consistency | Ad hoc interpretation per query | Semantic layer: define business metrics once, reuse everywhere |
| Data quality visibility | Not surfaced | Missing value analysis, duplicate detection, 3-sigma anomaly flags |
| Data cleaning before analysis | Not available | Interactive preprocessing wizard with user-controlled rules and full audit trail |

## Usage Examples

Upload any structured dataset, then ask in plain English:

```
"Why did revenue drop last month?"
-> Revenue fell 11% in February. South region contributed 22% of the decline due to reduced ad spend.

"Show the correlation between customer age and transaction value"
-> Heatmap generated inside the Python sandbox. The LLM received only column names, not values.

"Compare Product A and Product B this quarter"
-> Product A grew 8% week-on-week, outperforming Product B at 2%. Primary driver: higher return customer rate.

"What makes up total sales by region?"
-> North accounts for 40% of total sales. Retail contributes the majority within that share.

"Give me a weekly summary of customer metrics"
-> Signups up 5%, churn stable, average handle time improved by 12 seconds.
```

## Architecture Notes

DataTalk uses a multi-agent orchestration pattern. The Orchestrator classifies each incoming question into one of five intent categories and routes it to the appropriate specialist agent. Agents use the LLM only to translate intent into executable SQL or Python. Execution happens locally against the embedded analytical database, so the LLM acts as a translator, not a data processor.

DuckDB was selected for its columnar storage model, embedded execution with zero server infrastructure, and native support for Pandas DataFrames. Each session writes to its own isolated database file, ensuring complete data separation between users.

The Python sandbox is central to the system's analytical depth. Correlations, distributions, regressions, and clustering all require code execution that SQL cannot express. The sandbox makes this safe without sacrificing capability: the LLM generates code against column metadata, the sandbox executes it in isolation, and the result flows back to the user as a chart or summary.

The Preprocessing Wizard runs before data ever reaches DuckDB. By resolving data quality issues in a separate, user-validated phase, the wizard ensures that every subsequent SQL query, Python computation, and confidence score operates on the cleanest possible version of the dataset — and that the user retains full control over what was changed.
